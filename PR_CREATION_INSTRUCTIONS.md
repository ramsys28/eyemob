## 🐛 Issues Fixed

- **MediaPipe initialization failed** error
- **Failed to Initialize eyetracker** error  
- WASM loading failures
- Model loading failures from CDN
- Network connectivity issues

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Package Version Downgrade**
- Downgraded from `@mediapipe/tasks-vision@0.10.22-rc.20250304` (unstable RC) to `@mediapipe/tasks-vision@0.10.11` (stable)

### 2. **Updated WASM Loading URLs**

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added network connectivity validation before initialization
- Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed console logging

### 5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Added `MediaPipe_Initialization_Troubleshooting.md` with detailed troubleshooting guide
- Added `MEDIAIPIPE_FIXES_APPLIED.md` with summary of fixes and testing instructions

   - ✅ `FaceLandmarker created successfully`
   - ✅ `Eye tracker initialization completed successfully`

### Expected Results:
- ✅ No MediaPipe initialization errors
